# Championing Open-source DEvelopment in Machine Learning

Open-source software development is a cornerstone of modern machine learning research.
However, there are often overlooked issues around the
sustainability of long-term projects, the reliability of software,
and proper academic acknowledgment of long-term maintenance and contributions.
This workshop aims to identify and discuss strategies for successful and sustainable open-source development
in machine learning while also proposing possible solutions to the challenges mentioned above.
In addition, this workshop will serve as a platform to provide
academic and community recognition of efforts from open-source contributors in the field.
We will bring together machine learning researchers, engineers,
industrial practitioners, and software development experts.
The workshop will feature invited talks, panel discussions with experts,
and extended abstract submissions from open-source contributors in machine learning.

## Call for Papers

We invite high-quality extended abstract submissions on open-source software development in machine learning and adjacent fields. Some examples (non-exhaustive list): 

- Submissions that describe a new open-source machine learning software library 
- Submissions which explain a new addition, significant bug fixes, or changes to an established library
- Submissions that explore a scientific result across different versions of an (established) library
- Submissions on the technical setup (e.g. CI, testing) and best practices for reproducibility
- Proposals for better workflows or incentives for open-source development and maintenance in ML
<!-- - Proposals for workshops or events on how to build a community around software -->

### Submissions

Accepted submissions will be presented during joint poster sessions and will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing future submissions to archival conferences or journals. 

Submissions must be anonymous, in <span style="color:#3a92d6;font-weight:400;"><a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NeurIPS format</a></span> and not longer than **four pages**, excluding references, acknowledgments, and supplementary material. Long appendices are permitted but strongly discouraged, and reviewers are not required to read them. The review process is double-blind.

Please note that we do not accept submissions that have previously been published elsewhere or will be presented at the main NeurIPS conference.

<!-- We also welcome submissions of recently published work that is strongly within the scope of the workshop (with proper formatting). We encourage the authors of such submissions to focus on accessibility to the wider NeurIPS community while distilling their work into an extended abstract.  -->

Authors may be asked to review other workshop submissions.
